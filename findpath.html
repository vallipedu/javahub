   ## Packages and the Classpath

Packages in Java are a way to organize classes and interfaces into
 a logical hierarchy, mirroring the file system's directory structure.
For the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to find and load 
these packages, 
it relies on a concept called the **classpath**.
The classpath is a list of directories and/or JAR files 
where the JRE looks for compiled `.class` files.

-----

### How the JRE Finds Packages

By default, the JRE uses the **current working directory** 
as the starting point for its search. If your package structure, 
such as `org.edu.nbkrist.cse`, is a subdirectory of the current path,
 the JRE will be able to find the classes within it.

You can explicitly specify the classpath in two primary ways:

1.  **Using the `CLASSPATH` environment variable**: 
You can set this system-wide variable to include the paths to your 
class files.
2.  **Using the `-classpath` (or `-cp`) option**: 
This is a more common and flexible method, allowing you 
to specify the path for a single execution of the `java` or `javac` 
command.

-----

### Example: Running a Class from a Package

Let's consider a simple class within a package:

```java
// File: org/edu/nbkrist/cse/Test.java
package org.edu.nbkrist.cse;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String ar[]) {
        System.out.println("Package tester");
    }
}
```

To compile and run this class, you must ensure the classpath is
 correctly configured.

#### Method 1: Using the `-d` option for compilation
<div style="background-color: hsl(196, 65%, 73%); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
This method compiles the source file and places the resulting `.class` file into
 the appropriate directory structure relative to the specified 
 destination.

1.  **Compilation**:
    Assuming you are in the directory that will be the 
    root of your package (e.g., a `src` folder), 
    you can use the `-d .` option to tell the compiler 
    to place the output in the **current working directory**.

    ```bash
    > javac -d . Test.java
    ```

    This command compiles `Test.java` and creates the directory 
    structure `org/edu/nbkrist/cse` with `Test.class` inside it.

2.  **Running the program**:
    From the directory that is the root of your package
     (where the `org` folder is located),
      you can run the program by specifying the fully
       qualified class name.

    ```bash
    > java org.edu.nbkrist.cse.Test
    ```

    The JRE finds the class by starting its search 
    in the current directory and navigating through 
    the package structure `org/edu/nbkrist/cse`
     to find `Test.class`.

#### Method 2: Specifying the Classpath

This method is useful when your compiled `.class`
 files are in a different location than 
 your current working directory. The `-classpath` flag
  tells the JVM **where to look** for the class files.

  * **What is the classpath?**
    Think of the classpath as a **search path** for the JVM.
     It's a list of locations—directories or JAR files—that 
     the JVM scans to find the `.class`
      files needed to run a program. 
      Without a correct classpath, the JVM will 
      throw a `NoClassDefFoundError` because it can't find the 
      necessary class files.

  * **Example Usage**:
    If you're in a project's root directory (`my-project/`)
     and your compiled `.class` files are in a subdirectory 
     named `bin`, you would use the following command to run your
      main class (`com.mycompany.Main`):

    ```bash
    > java -classpath bin com.mycompany.Main
    ```

    The `-classpath bin` part tells the JVM to look inside 
    the `bin` directory to find the `com.mycompany.Main.class` file.
